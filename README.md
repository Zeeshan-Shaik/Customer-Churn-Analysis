# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Project

This is an end-to-end **Customer Churn Analysis** project using **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**. The goal is to identify key factors that lead to customer churn in a telecom company and create actionable insights for stakeholders.

---

## 🧠 Objective
Analyze historical customer data to:
- Identify churn trends and patterns
- Build predictive models to classify churners
- Visualize KPIs using Power BI dashboards

---

## 🐘 SQL Tasks
- Cleaned raw telecom customer data
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables
- Exported cleaned dataset for modeling

> 📂 File: `SQL/churn_data_cleaning.sql`

---

## 🐍 Python Tasks
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Evaluation Metrics: Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

> 📂 File: `Python_Modeling/churn_modeling.ipynb`

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
- KPIs: Total Customers, Churn Rate, Monthly Revenue, Avg Tenure
- Churn breakdown by:
  - Contract Type
  - Tenure
  - Monthly Charges
  - Senior Citizen / Gender
- Filters for interactive slicing

## ✅ Results
- Random Forest achieved **~80% Accuracy** with tuned hyperparameters
- Identified key churn factors:
  - Lower tenure
  - Higher monthly charges
  - Month-to-month contracts

---

## 📌 Key Learnings
- Real-world data wrangling and cleaning in SQL
- Hands-on model building and tuning in Python
- Dashboard design and storytelling using Power BI

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements
